## Key implementation details

- **Architecture:** Standalone components + routing, clean separation of layout (header/content/footer)
- **Styling:** Sass partials (`_core.sass`, `_responsive.sass`) + global utilities and mixins
- **i18n:** Translation files in `src/assets/i18n` (`de.json`, `en.json`)
- **UX:** Scroll helpers + lightweight animations (kept subtle to stay professional)

---

## Architecture & design decisions

- **Standalone components:** Simplifies module structure and keeps sections self-contained.
- **Translation pipeline:** Central JSON dictionaries keep text consistent and easy to update.
- **Responsive strategy:** Each section has dedicated `_responsive.sass` partials with shared mixins.
- **Progressive enhancement:** Features like reveal animations are subtle and optional.

---

## Feature deep dive

- **Navigation & language switcher:** DE/EN toggle updates UI copy via `@ngx-translate`.
- **Contact form flow:** Inline validation, privacy consent requirement, success/error feedback.
- **Project cards:** External links and short descriptions for recruiter-friendly scanning.

---

## Proof of work (project highlights)

- **Join:** Kanban-inspired task manager with drag-and-drop and assignment flows.
- **Pollo Loco:** Jump’n’Run with item collection and enemy interactions.
- **Pokédex:** PokéAPI-based catalog for viewing and filtering Pokémon data.

---

## Project structure (high level)

- `src/app` – root component, routing and application shell
- `src/app/header` – header, navigation and language switcher
- `src/app/content` – main sections (hero, skill set, projects, contact, etc.)
- `src/app/footer` – footer with legal links
- `src/assets` – images, icons and translation files (`i18n`)
- `src/styles` – global styles, mixins and shared utilities

---

## Getting started

## Testing

**Unit tests**
- Component tests cover navigation behavior, language switching, and the contact form flow.
- Run with: `npm test`

**Manual E2E smoke checks**
- Start the app with `npm start`.
- Verify navigation anchor links scroll to the correct sections.
- Switch language (DE/EN) and confirm the UI copy updates.
